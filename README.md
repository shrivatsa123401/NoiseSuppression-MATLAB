#  Noise Suppression using Deep Learning in MATLAB

This project implements a deep learning-based approach for speech enhancement by suppressing background noise using MATLAB. It utilizes MATLAB‚Äôs **Audio Toolbox** and **Deep Learning Toolbox**, and is trained on the **Microsoft DNS Challenge** dataset.

##  Dataset

- **Microsoft DNS Challenge Dataset**
  - A publicly available dataset containing paired clean and noisy audio samples.
  - Ideal for training supervised speech enhancement models.
  - [Dataset Info](https://dns-challenge.microsoft.org)
